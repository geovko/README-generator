  ## Description  

  Typically in a project, the majority of the coder's focus is placed on the actual coding that carries the project. However, the README file itself is just as important as it acts as a landing page for a user to get a proper understanding of the project and how to utilize it. Through this project, I have tried to make the README file creation process more streamlined by developing a program that takes in inputs and generates a README file for the user. The main focus for me during the development process was utilizing the tools for writing files from inputs prompted by *inquirer*.
  
  ## Usage  
  
  The user must first open the terminal from the file location and install inquirer version 8.2.4 by typing in *npm install inquirer@8.2.4*.

  The user is then prompted to answer a list of questions which will then generate a README file populated with their responses.
